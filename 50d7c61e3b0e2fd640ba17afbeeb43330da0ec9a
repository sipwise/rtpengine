      "message": "In the dpkg-buildpackage case and several of the dpkg-dev scripts the option parsing is a bit of a mess, and still needs to be cleaned up and unified. They all should accept bundled values in short options, which I think is pretty standard practice. They might also accept equals.\n\nThe problem in the man page is that documenting all variations is a bit tedious. Once these all have an uniform parsing then I guess a paragraph explaining this might be in order, but listing them for each option would seem too distracting. :)",
