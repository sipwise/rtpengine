Given that this rule requires the build-arch and/or build-readme targets to have been called before, but that\u0027s not guaranteed when these are all listed as prerequisites for binary-*.\n\nI think these need to be inlined on each binary target. And then some commands can just be removed as irrelevant. For example dh_strip, dh_makeshlibs and dh_shlibdeps for binary-indep.",
